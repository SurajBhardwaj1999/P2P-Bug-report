# P2P-OBJECTIVE
Attached are a few test case reports for your review.

Description : The project “BITZIANA” is an online trading platform but we are given the feature of Currency Exchange. In this, our client provides trading symbol pairs of FOREXES, CRYPTO, Indices, Metal, etc. Here we are given the freedom to make trades like other trading platforms and also, they can exchange their currencies with another person. In this project, we are making a list of currencies with their price if somebody has a currency in the US and wants to exchange it with INR so they have to be given the SELL and BUY price for listing their order on our platform. We have two parts in this web application First is a currency exchange and the second is for placing trades at current market prices like MT5, Groww, Coindhan etc.
